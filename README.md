# GroundTruth
The file contains manuallty annotated coordinates of 14 985 job advertisements in 29 different newspaper titles from ANNO corpus. Each line contains a link to a page in the ANNO corpus and coordinates of all job advertisements on that page.

Each job ad is labeled as one of the following categories:
- job_offer for job offers,
- job_search for job searches,
- service_offer for somebody offering services,
- vermittlung for job ads from mediation offices,
- heading for a heading indicating that a job ads sections starts,
- indicators for more general headings indicating that an ads section starts.

Ground truth was created as part of the JobAds (FWF P35783) and published as part of the conference paper _Who Advertises in Newspapers? Data Criticism in Mining Historical Job Ads_ submitted to the CHR2024 conference. Authors' names will be added after the anonymity period is over. We thank Austrian National Library for providing data from the ANNO corpus.
